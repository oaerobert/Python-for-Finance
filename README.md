# 🐍 for Finance 
Hey! 👋🏾 

My name is Oke and I'm currently a second year Mathematical Economics & Statistics student at the University of Birmingham.
As a testament to my work ethic and self-learning journey, I bought the textbook "Python for Finance" - enabling me to refine my technical proficiencies in Python and its libraries (NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib). 

I've been working through it, and I'm documenting the projects of this textbook within this repository.

This repository showcases my work with Python in analysing and visualising financial data, alongisde simulating stock market behaviours. 📈

### 1. S&P 500 Data Visualization 📊
- I used the libraries **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to provide clear visualisations of:
  - Relative volatilities of different stocks.
  - Historical trends and patterns in the stock market using real S&P 500 data.
- Designed user-friendly graphs and plots to make data insights easily interpretable.

### 2. Monte Carlo Simulations 
- I developed a Monte Carlo simulation model for stock price forecasting.
- This simulation includes:
  - User-defined parameters such as initial stock price, number of simulations, and time of maturity.
  - Aimed to help users assess risk and potential returns effectively.

## What technologies did I utilise for this project?
- **Python**: The core programming language for this project.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: To handle and process large datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating detailed and insightful visualizations.

## How to Use
Take a look at the files within this repository. The titles correspond to the appropriate project 😇
- Ensure you install the required libraries.
- Copy and paste the code into Python.
- Adapt the code to your specific data and user inputs and use to your discretion :)
