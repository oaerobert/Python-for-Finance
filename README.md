## 🐍 for Finance 
Hey! 👋🏾 

My name is Oke and I'm currently a second year Mathematical Economics & Statistics student at the University of Birmingham.
- I bought the textbook "Python for Finance" which currently is enabling me to refine my technical proficiencies in Python and its libraries (**NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels and Matplotlib**). 

I've been working through it and I'm documenting the projects of this textbook within this repository. 

- This repository showcases my work with Python in analysing and visualising financial data, alongside simulating stock market behaviours and performing statistical tests 📈

#### 1. S&P 500 Data Visualisation 📊
I used the libraries **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to provide clear visualisations of:
  - Relative volatilities of different stocks.
  - Historical trends and patterns in the stock market using real S&P 500 data.
- Designed user-friendly graphs and plots to make data insights easily interpretable.

#### 2. Monte Carlo Simulations ⏩
I developed a Monte Carlo simulation model for stock price forecasting. I used **NumPy**
- This simulation includes:
  - User-defined parameters such as initial stock price, number of simulations, and time of maturity.
  - Aimed to help users assess risk and potential returns effectively.
