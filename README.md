# Financial Mathematics üéØ
## Overview

Welcome to my Financial Mathematics project! This project demonstrates Python-based implementations of the "Python for Finance" textbook, which I am currently using to teach myself mathematical fundamentals in finance and python. Here, I apply my learnt computational techniques.

I‚Äôm currently a second-year **Mathematical Economics** student at the University of Birmingham, and I‚Äôm self-teaching myself to enhance my understanding of quantitative finance. This project is part of my personal journey to develop practical skills and build a portfolio showcasing my ability to combine mathematics, economics, and programming.

The most foundational project here, is the **Black Scholes Model**

## What is the Black-Scholes Model? ü§î
The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical framework used for pricing European call and put options. It was introduced by **Fischer Black**, **Myron Scholes**, and later refined by **Robert Merton**. The model relies on the assumptions of efficient markets, no arbitrage, and a log-normal distribution of asset prices. The key formula calculates the theoretical price of an option based on variables such as:

- **Current stock price (S)**
- **Strike price (K)**
- **Time to maturity (T)**
- **Risk-free interest rate (r)**
- **Volatility of the underlying asset (œÉ)**

## Key Features of the Project

- **Numerical Simulation**: The Python implementation uses **Monte Carlo methods** to simulate option prices based on the Black-Scholes framework.
- **Analytical Pricing**: The project also includes the closed-form solution to calculate European option prices directly.
- **Visualization**: Data visualizations help compare simulated prices with analytical prices, enhancing understanding.
- **Flexible Parameters**: Users can easily modify inputs like stock price, strike price, time to maturity, volatility, and risk-free rate.

## Motivation üèÜ

As someone passionate about **mathematics and coding**, I find the intersection of these fields in quantitative finance fascinating. The Black-Scholes model, being a cornerstone of modern finance, serves as an excellent starting point for learning about option pricing. By building this project, I aim to:

- Strengthen my mathematical understanding of stochastic processes.
- Gain practical experience in implementing financial models using Python.
- Build a portfolio project that highlights my quantitative and programming skills.

## How to Use

1. **Install Requirements**: Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries such as `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.
2. **Run the Code**: Clone the repository and execute the script to simulate option prices or compare them with the analytical Black-Scholes formula.
3. **Modify Parameters**: Adjust the inputs in the code to test different market scenarios.

## Example Output

This project includes visualizations, such as:

- The convergence of Monte Carlo simulation results to the analytical price.
- Option price sensitivity to changes in volatility or time to maturity.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of **stochastic calculus** and its role in financial modeling.
- Practical application of Python for **numerical methods** and **data visualization**.
- A deeper appreciation for the Black-Scholes model‚Äôs strengths and limitations.

## Future Plans

This is just the beginning of my journey into **financial mathematics**. Future enhancements to this project could include:

- Simulating more complex models (e.g., **Heston model**).
- Extending to **American options** using finite difference methods.
- Integrating live market data for real-time option pricing.
