## 🐍 for Finance 
Hey! 👋🏾 

My name is Oke and I'm currently a second year Mathematical Economics & Statistics student at the University of Birmingham.
- I bought the textbook "Python for Finance" which currently is enabling me to refine my technical proficiencies in Python and its libraries (**NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib**). 

I've been working through it and I'm documenting the projects of this textbook within this repository. 
Not only that, but I'm also using Python for my econometric assingments (we are required to use STATA) to demonstrate versatility. In Python, I aim to demonstrate hypothesis testing, regression analysis and data visualisation using Python libraries.

- This repository showcases my work with Python in analysing and visualising financial data, alongside simulating stock market behaviours and performing statistical tests 📈

#### 1. S&P 500 Data Visualisation 📊
I used the libraries **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to provide clear visualisations of:
  - Relative volatilities of different stocks.
  - Historical trends and patterns in the stock market using real S&P 500 data.
- Designed user-friendly graphs and plots to make data insights easily interpretable.

#### 2. Monte Carlo Simulations ⏩
I developed a Monte Carlo simulation model for stock price forecasting. I used **NumPy**
- This simulation includes:
  - User-defined parameters such as initial stock price, number of simulations, and time of maturity.
  - Aimed to help users assess risk and potential returns effectively.

### If you would like to see this code in action 🏄🏾‍♀️...
Take a look at the files within this repository. The titles correspond to the appropriate project 😇
- Ensure you install the required libraries.
- Copy and paste the code into Python.
- Adapt the code to your specific data and user inputs and use to your discretion :)
