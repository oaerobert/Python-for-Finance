### S&P 500 Analysis

#### Overview 🧘🏾
Hey! 🤸🏾

This project contains useful code and analytics on the historial returns and rolling volatility of the S&P 500. This is done to identify market trends and assess risk. 
Here I demonstrate core skills of time-series modelling, data visualisation and Python programming 🏏

---
### What key skills do I demonstrate? 🎯

Here, I utilise the Python libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas. I use these libraries to carry out mathematical operations (NumPy) and then for obtaining information on the data (Pandas). It is also crucial to effectively visualise the data (Matplotlib) to conduct effective data analysis and interpretation.

The purpose of this is to assess the rolling volatilities of the Standard and Poors 500 index. This will help to demonstrate periods of market uncertainty.

### Repository Structure
- `data`: Contains the dataset that I've used to make this happen.

- `scripts`: Python scripts for the analysis (`S&P500.py`)
  
- `notebooks`: Interactive Jupyter Notebook that showcases the analysis of the S&P 500
  
- `README.md`: Project description and usage (you're reading it write now! :) )
